  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">JavaScript,</span> often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
